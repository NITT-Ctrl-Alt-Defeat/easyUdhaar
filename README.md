# ðŸ’³easyUdhaar

## The USPs of **easyUdhaar** are :



1. The use of non-formal data to calculate the **credit score** of a potential borrower which **empowers** the poor borrowers (who are not able to provide sufficient collateral) to avail loans at low rates **promoting financial inclusion.**
2. A unique way of calculating lender rewards called **EasyRewards**, which leverage the **economies of scale **effect of the Visa network to generate **sustainable rewards **while **rapidly growing the number of transactions** for Visa
3. The** involvement of pre-exisiting government schemes **to provide aid (not loans) to people whose **credit scores are above a certain risk threshold**. This helps the government by** identifying the people who need government aid the most**. Certain government schemes that provide **default insurance** to banks are also highlighted and further detailed upon in the presentation

## Types of Users:



1. Lender 
2. Borrower

**All transactions are implemented via Visa Direct API.**


## Lender

A lender can **explore active campaigns** and **lend money to the campaign** of their choice and thus earn interest and as well as **EasyRewards **on it.

He can lend to multiple campaigns and the system monitors his contributions to different campaigns, the return on his investment and his earned **EasyRewards** on the Dashboard.


## Borrower

A borrower **set up a campaign** to generate funds which will constitute a **business or a personal** loan. He is permitted to setup only one campaign at a time. The information he fills up in the application will be used to **calculate the credit score**. His **previous credit scores** will be used as well and generate a new credit score **via a time-series integration.**

The borrower will be able to **track his campaign progress and fund status** via the Dashboard. He will also be able to repay his campaignâ€™s lenders. 

Early repayment is incentivised by lower interest rate.
