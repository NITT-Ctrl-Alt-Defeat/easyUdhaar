# ðŸ’³easyUdhaar

## The USPs of **easyUdhaar** are :



1. The use of non-formal data to calculate the **credit score **of a potential borrower which **empowers **the poor borrowers (who are not able to provide sufficient collateral) to avail loans at low rates **promoting financial inclusion.**
2. A unique way of calculating lender rewards called **EasyRewards**, which leverage the **economies of scale **effect of the Visa network to generate **sustainable rewards** while **rapidly growing the number of transactions** for Visa
3. The** involvement of pre-exisiting government schemes **to provide aid (not loans) to people whose **credit scores are above a certain risk threshold**. This helps the government by** identifying the people who need government aid the most**. Certain government schemes that provide **default insurance** to banks are also highlighted and further detailed upon in the presentation
