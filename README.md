# ðŸ’³easyUdhaar

easyUdhaar is a **microlending** startup that **uses financial and non-financial data** to analyze **credit risk** of an applicant and then provide **crowdsourced loans** **at an affordable rate**. It proposes to **collaborate with the government** by integrating **pre-existing schemes** to **identify people most in need** of capital and also to **insure against loan default** under certain conditions.

1. The use of **non-financial data** to calculate the **credit score** of a potential borrower help us **financially include** colateral-lacking borrowers by giving them **access to low-interest loans** which they would not have been able to procure through conventional avenues. 
2. A unique way of calculating lender rewards called **EasyRewards**, which leverages the **economies of scale** effect of the Visa network to generate **sustainable rewards** while **rapidly growing the number of transactions** for Visa
3. The **involvement of pre-exisiting government schemes** to provide aid (not loans) to people whose **credit scores are above a certain risk threshold**. This helps the government by **identifying the people who need government aid the most**. Certain government schemes that provide **default insurance** to banks are also highlighted and further detailed upon in the presentation

 Repository for [Credit Score API](https://github.com/NITT-Ctrl-Alt-Defeat/credit-score)

## Types of Users:



1. Lender 
2. Borrower

**All transactions are implemented via Visa Direct API(VISA pull and push funds transfer).**


## Lender

A lender can **explore active campaigns** and **lend money to the campaign** of their choice and thus earn interest and as well as **EasyRewards**.

He can lend to multiple campaigns and the system monitors his contributions to different campaigns, the return on his investment and his earned **EasyRewards** on the Dashboard.


## Borrower

A borrower **set up a campaign** to generate funds which will constitute a **business or a personal** loan. He is permitted to setup only one campaign at a time. The information he fills up in the application will be used to **calculate the credit score**. His **previous credit scores** will be used as well and generate a new credit score **via a time-series integration.**

The borrower will be able to **track his campaign progress and fund status** via the Dashboard. He will also be able to repay his campaignâ€™s lenders. 

Early repayment is incentivised by lower interest rate.
